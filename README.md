# Open Idea

Rebuilding the Open Idea platform with a modular, future-friendly architecture.

## Vision

- **Product**: collaborative research and knowledge graph tools for open innovation.
- **Approach**: mono-repo to modular workspace split across frontends, backend services, shared packages, and infrastructure.
- **Goal**: document every step of the rebuild so progress stays transparent and reversible.

## Current Status

This repository starts as a clean slate. The legacy mono-repo lives at `../Ecosyz-search` and remains the source of truth during the migration.

### Immediate Focus

1. Capture a complete audit of the legacy code.
2. Define the target modular architecture.
3. Incrementally port functionality into the new structure with tests and docs.

See `docs/` for living documents that track the rebuild.
